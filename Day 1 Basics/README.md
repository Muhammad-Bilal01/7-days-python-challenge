# Welcome to Day 1 of 7 Days Python Challenge

<img src="./Day 01 of Oython Challenge.png">

## Topics Covered

- **Python setup and installation**: The process of downloading and installing Python, as well as setting up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VS Code.
- **Writing the first program**: Using the `print` function to display output, such as "Hello, World!".
- **Variables and data types**: Variables are containers for storing data values.

- **Data types** define the type of data a variable can hold, such as integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), booleans (boolean), and NoneType (None). We can find data type of any variable with `type()` methods.
- **Operators**: Symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
  - **Arithmetic operators**: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
  - **Relational operators**: Compare two values and return a boolean (e.g., equal to (`==`), not equal to (`!=`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`)).
  - **Logical operators**: Combine conditional statements (e.g., and (`and`), or (`or`), not (`not`)).
  - **Assignment operators**: Assign values to variables (e.g., equal to (`=`), plus-equal (`+=`), minus-equal (`-=`)).
- **Taking user input**: Using the `input` function to get input from the user.
- **Writing comments**: Adding explanations or notes within the code using `#`.
- **Type conversion and type casting**: Converting one data type to another (e.g., converting a string to an integer using `int()`).

## Learning Outcomes

- Successfully installed Python and set up the development environment.
- Understood basic syntax and wrote the first Python program.
- Learned about different data types and how to use them.
- Practiced using various operators for arithmetic and logical operations.
- Implemented user input and learned how to handle it.
- Added comments to the code for better readability.
- Converted between different data types and understood type casting.

## Practice Questions

1. Write a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. Create variables of different data types (int, float, str, boolean) and print their values.
3. Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.
4. Demonstrate the use of arithmetic operators by writing a program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
5. Create a program that checks if a number is greater than, less than, or equal to another number using relational operators.
6. Write a program that takes a user's age as input and prints whether they are an adult (age >= 18) or not using logical operators.
7. Show how to use assignment operators to update the value of a variable.
8. Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints a personalized greeting.
9. Demonstrate how to add comments to your code and explain what they are used for.
10. Create a program that converts a string representing a number into an integer and a float, and then prints the results.

## Code Examples

### First Program

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Variables and Data Types

```python
age = 25  # int
height = 5.9  # float
name = "Alice"  # str
is_student = True  # boolean
not_assigned = None  # NoneType
print(age, height, name, is_student, not_assigned)
```

## Taking User Input

```python
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {user_name}!")
```

## Type Conversion

```python
num_str = "100"
num_int = int(num_str)
num_float = float(num_str)
print(num_int, num_float)
```
