## Introduction

This challenge is designed to help you learn the basics of Python programming in 7 days. Each day focuses on a different aspect of Python, with hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning.

## Day 1: Introduction and Setup

- Learn basic syntax: variables, data types (integers, floats, strings), and basic operations.
- Learn Operators in pyton.
- Write your first Python program: `print("Hello, World!")`

## Day 2: Control Flow

- Learn about conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Understand loops: `for` and `while`
- Explore list comprehensions for concise loops
- Operators for Conditionals

## Day 3: Data Structures

- Lists: creation, indexing, slicing, and basic methods
- Tuples: immutable lists and their uses
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs, adding/removing elements, and common methods
- Sets: unique elements, basic operations like union and intersection

## Day 4: Functions and Modules

- Defining functions using the `def` keyword
- Function parameters, return values, and default arguments
- Importing and using standard library modules (e.g., `math`, `datetime`)

## Day 5: File Handling and Exceptions

- Reading from and writing to files
- Handling exceptions with `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks
- Practice: Write programs that read from a file, process data, and handle potential errors

## Day 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Understanding classes and objects
- Instance methods and class attributes
- Basic inheritance and method overriding

## Day 7: Practice and Projects

- Build simple projects like a calculator, to-do list app, or a basic web scraper
- Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal
- Review and refine everything you've learned

## What's Next

After completing the 7 Days Python Challenge, you can continue to expand your Python knowledge and skills by exploring the following:

- Advanced data structures and algorithms
- Popular Python libraries and frameworks (e.g., Pandas, Flask, Django, TensorFlow)
- Software development practices (e.g., version control with Git, writing unit tests)
- Building more complex projects and contributing to open-source projects
